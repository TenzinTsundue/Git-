Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
<br>
Version Control System (VCS) is a software that helps software developers to work together and maintain a complete history of their work.
<br>
Listed below are the functions of a VCS −
- Allows developers to work simultaneously.
- Does not allow overwriting each other’s changes.
- Maintains a history of every version.

General workflow/life cycle is as follows −
- You clone the Git repository as a working copy.
- You modify the working copy by adding/editing files.
- If necessary, you also update the working copy by taking other developer's changes.
- You review the changes before commit.
- You commit changes. If everything is fine, then you push the changes to the repository.
- After committing, if you realize something is wrong, then you correct the last commit and push the changes to the repository.
